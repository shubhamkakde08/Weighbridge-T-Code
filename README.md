## üß≠ Overview

This project contains the SQL view `VIEW_WEIGHBRIDGE_TCODE`, a master configuration that defines the logic, rules, and conditions for various types of weighbridge transactions used in the ERP system.

Each transaction type (e.g., RM Inward, Sale Return, Yard Transfer) is mapped with essential metadata that governs:

- Required gate passes
- Order dependencies
- Fields to show or hide
- Item nature applicability
- Whether approval is required
- ESBS (Electronic Slip Booking System) mapping
